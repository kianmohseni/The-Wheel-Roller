# Project Overview

## 🛞 The Wheel Roller – Rubber Band Powered Vehicle
A mechanically engineered, 3D-printed vehicle designed for autonomous motion using elastic potential energy stored in rubber bands. Created as part of UCLA’s MAE 94 CAD & Drafting course.

## 🔧 Overview
- Designed a rubber-band powered vehicle from scratch using SolidWorks.

- Final design included 7 interlocking 3D-printed parts, assembled without glue.

- Power is delivered through four twisted rubber bands that convert stored energy into forward motion.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- CAD: SolidWorks

- Manufacturing: 3D Printing (PLA)

- Design Methodology: Iterative prototyping & theoretical force modeling

- Team Skills: CAD modeling, mechanical prototyping, energy transfer analysis

## 📐 Key Features
- 3D-printed assembly with minimal friction interfaces

- Peg-twist rubber band propulsion mechanism

- Durable, lightweight design

- Manufactured in ~11 hours using PLA with varied infill

## 🚀 Performance
- Traveled up to 5 meters during pre-competition testing

- Demonstrated stable and self-propelled motion on flat surfaces

- Performance limited slightly by friction in peg-hole interface

## 🔁 Lessons & Next Steps
- Simplifying part geometry makes assembly and manufacturing more efficient

- Uniform infill percentages reduce print time and part variation

- Future improvements: disassemblable peg-hole system for lubrication & friction reduction
